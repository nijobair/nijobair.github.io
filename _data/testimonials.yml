  review: "Nazmul was a fantastic data analysis freelancer who went above and beyond expectations. He quickly grasped our business needs and identified key performance indicators (KPIs) like customer acquisition cost and churn rate. Using his Excel mastery, he built a dynamic dashboard that automatically updates with new data, saving us hours of manual work.... I highly recommend Nazmul to anyone seeking a skilled, proactive, and communicative data analyst."
