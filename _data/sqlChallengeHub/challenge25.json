Write a query to calculate the weighted average score for each student and list their full names along with the weighted average score rounded to nearest 2 decimal in a column named `weighted_avg_score`.",

    "difficulty": 4,
    "hint": "To calculate weighted scores just right,\nMultiply and sum, it's quite a sight.\nDivide by weights, each field in play,\nTo find the average in this way."
