<h1 align="center">Website with GitHub Pages & Jekyll</h1>

Making and hosting a website with GitHub pages and Jekyll is super easy if you have the right resources and a bit of knowledge of Jekyll, HTML, and CSS. I have used one of the Jekyll themes (merlot) as a starting point and made necessary changes afterwards. If you want to do the same, below are some resources to help you:

- Start by learning about [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
