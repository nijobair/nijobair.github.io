Making and hosting a website with GitHub pages and Jekyll is super easy if you have the right resources and a bit of knowledge of Jekyll, HTML, and CSS. I have used one of the Jekyll themes (merlot) as a starting point and made necessary changes afterwards. If you want to do the same, below are some resources to help you:
