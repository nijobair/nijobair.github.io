/*
This SQL query selects the full names of students who have a difference of 40 or more marks between any two subjects.
1. `SELECT full_name FROM students`: Selects the `full_name` of students from the `students` table.
2. `WHERE (...) >= 40`: Filters the results to include only those students who have a difference of 40 or more marks between any two subjects. The `CASE` statements calculate the absolute difference between two subject scores and check if it is greater than or equal to 40.

In summary, this query provides the names of students who have a significant difference in scores between any two subjects.
