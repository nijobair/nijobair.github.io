## Introduction

SQL is a powerful tool for querying and managing data, but like any skill, it takes practice to master. This holiday season, I challenged myself to complete **24 Days of SQL Advent Calendar Challenge**, a series of SQL problems designed to test and improve my skills. Each challenge presented unique scenarios that required creativity, logic, and a deep understanding of SQL concepts.

In this post, I’ll share my solutions to the challenges along with explanations for how I approached each problem. My goal is to provide clear and concise answers while offering insights into the thought process behind the queries. Whether you’re a beginner looking to learn or an experienced SQL user seeking new ideas, I hope you find this post helpful and inspiring.

#### Challenge - 01

**Question:** A ski resort company want to know which customers rented ski equipment for more than one type of activity (e.g., skiing and snowboarding). List the customer names and the number of distinct activities they rented equipment for.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS dist_activity
FROM rentals
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING dist_activity > 1;
```
**Comment:** This is a straight forward question. The question is to get the distinct count of the activities per customer. So, I grouped the results by customer name and then filtered the result to get the customers with more than one distinct activities.

**Question:** Santa wants to know which gifts weigh more than 1 kg. Can you list them?

**Question:** You’re trying to identify the most calorie-packed candies to avoid during your holiday binge. Write a query to rank candies based on their calorie count within each category. Include the candy name, category, calories, and rank (rank_in_category) within the category.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT 
    candy_name, 
    candy_category, 
    calories, 
    rank() OVER(
      PARTITION BY candy_category 
      ORDER BY calories
    ) AS rank_in_category 
FROM 
  candy_nutrition;
```
**Comment:** This one is interesting! The question tells us to rank the candies within each category. So I created windows/ partitions for each category and within that window applied the `rank()` function and then sorted the results by calories.

**Question:** You’re planning your next ski vacation and want to find the best regions with heavy snowfall. Given the tables resorts and snowfall, find the average snowfall for each region and sort the regions in descending order of average snowfall. Return the columns region and average_snowfall.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
    ski.region,
    avg(snow.snowfall_inches) AS average_snowfall
FROM ski_resorts AS ski
    LEFT JOIN snowfall AS snow
        USING(resort_id)
GROUP BY ski.region
ORDER BY average_snowfall DESC; 
```

**Question:** Scientists are tracking polar bears across the Arctic to monitor their migration patterns and caloric intake. Write a query to find the top 3 polar bears that have traveled the longest total distance in December 2024. Include their bear_id, bear_name, and total_distance_traveled in the results.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
    pb.bear_id,
    pb.bear_name,
    sum(tr.distance_km) AS total_distance_traveled
FROM polar_bears AS pb
    INNER JOIN tracking AS tr
        ON pb.bear_id = tr.bear_id
WHERE strftime('%m', date) = "12"   -- BETWEEN also works.
    AND strftime('%Y', date) = "2024"
GROUP BY
    pb.bear_id,
    pb.bear_name
ORDER BY total_distance_traveled DESC
LIMIT 3;

**Question:** The owner of a winter market wants to know which vendors have generated the highest revenue overall. For each vendor, calculate the total revenue for all their items and return a list of the top 2 vendors by total revenue. Include the vendor_name and total_revenue in your results.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
    v.vendor_name,
    sum(
        s.quantity_sold * s.price_per_unit
        ) AS total_revenue
FROM vendors AS v
    LEFT JOIN sales AS s
        USING(vendor_id)    -- Same name in both tables.
GROUP BY v.vendor_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 2;
