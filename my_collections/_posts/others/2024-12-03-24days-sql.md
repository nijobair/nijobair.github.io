## Introduction

SQL is a powerful tool for querying and managing data, but like any skill, it takes practice to master. This holiday season, I challenged myself to complete **24 Days of SQL Advent Calendar Challenge**, a series of SQL problems designed to test and improve my skills. Each challenge presented unique scenarios that required creativity, logic, and a deep understanding of SQL concepts.

In this post, I’ll share my solutions to the challenges along with explanations for how I approached each problem. My goal is to provide clear and concise answers while offering insights into the thought process behind the queries. Whether you’re a beginner looking to learn or an experienced SQL user seeking new ideas, I hope you find this post helpful and inspiring.

**Question:** A ski resort company want to know which customers rented ski equipment for more than one type of activity (e.g., skiing and snowboarding). List the customer names and the number of distinct activities they rented equipment for.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS dist_activity
FROM rentals
GROUP BY customer_name
HAVING dist_activity > 1;
```
**Comment:** This is a straight forward question. The question is to get the distinct count of the activities per customer. So, I grouped the results by customer name and then filtered the result to get the customers with more than one distinct activities.

**Question:** Santa wants to know which gifts weigh more than 1 kg. Can you list them?

**Answer:**
```sql

**Question:** You’re trying to identify the most calorie-packed candies to avoid during your holiday binge. Write a query to rank candies based on their calorie count within each category. Include the candy name, category, calories, and rank (rank_in_category) within the category.

**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT 
    candy_name, 
    candy_category, 
    calories, 
    rank() OVER(
      PARTITION BY candy_category 
      ORDER BY calories
    ) AS rank_in_category 
FROM 
  candy_nutrition;
```
**Comment:** This one is interesting! The question tells us to rank the candies within each category. So I created windows/ partitions for each category and within that window applied the `rank()` function and then sorted the results by calories.
