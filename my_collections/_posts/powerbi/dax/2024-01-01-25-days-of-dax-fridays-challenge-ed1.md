## Introduction

Learning `DAX` can be scary and frustrating at times.`import pandas as pd`  Understanding some functions can take time. But with practice anything is possible, so is learning DAX. Unlike other programming languages, DAX doesn't have that rich resources. This makes it ever harder to learn DAX. Luckily, there are some, though not enough, resources which provides us with a chance to practice DAX. One such resource is the **"25 days of DAX Fridays!"** Challenge by **CURBAL**. In this post, I will share my solution to the first edition of the challenge.

## About the Challenge

    FILTER(
        Products,
        AND(Products[Unit Price] < 20, Products[Discontinued] = FALSE())
    )   -- Products[Unit Price] < 20 && Products[Discontinued] = FALSE() --> Same as AND()
)
```

#### Challenge 02:
- **Which product is the most expensive?**
```dax
CALCULATE(
    VALUES(Products[ProductName]),

    )
)
```

RETURN
    CALCULATE(

        Products[UnitPrice] > avgPrice   -- Why can't I use the measure from the previous day (3) here?
    )
)
```
