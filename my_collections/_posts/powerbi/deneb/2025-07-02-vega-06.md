## Introduction

In the previous post, we looked at how to get data into Vega. Once the data is in, the next step is to shape it according to your visualization needs. That’s where data transformation comes in.

In Vega, we can perform transformations right inside the `data` block of each dataset definition. Vega offers a wide range of built-in transformations, but in this post, we’ll focus on the most useful and commonly used ones. If you're curious, you can explore the full list of available transformations [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/transforms/).

## Transformations

Transformations come in many forms. You might want to add new columns, remove existing ones, filter rows, calculate statistics, perform lookups, or aggregate data—the list goes on.

All of these actions happen inside the `transform` property of a dataset. This property takes an array, so you can apply multiple transformations in sequence. Each transformation builds on the result of the previous one.

Let’s walk through some of the most useful transformations with examples and explanations.

### 1. Calculated Columns

If you’re coming from a Power BI background, the term *calculated column* should feel familiar.

In Vega, we can create new columns (or overwrite existing ones) using formulas. To do this, we use the `formula` transform with these properties:

1. `type`: For calculated columns, this should be `formula`.
2. `as`: The name of the new column. If the name already exists, it will be overwritten.
3. `expr`: The formula to be applied to each row.

Here, we need to understand the concept of `datum` in Vega. It represents the current row of the dataset (row context, Power BI folks!). You can access a field in the row using `datum.ColumnName` or `datum['Column Name']`.

Vega supports a wide range of expressions. You can check them out [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/expressions/).

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "exampleFormula",
      "values": [
        {"a": 9, "b": 7, "c": 5},
        {"a": 19, "b": 27, "c": 35},
        {"a": 99, "b": null, "c": 59}
      ],
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "formula",
          "as": "Simple Addition",
          "expr": "datum.a + datum.c"
        },
        {
          "type": "formula",
          "as": "Logical Calc",
          "expr": "if( isNumber( datum.b ), datum['Simple Addition'] - datum.b, NaN )"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Aggregating

The `aggregate` transform is used to group and summarize data. You can perform operations like _count, sum, average, min, max, variance, distinct_, and more (full list [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/transforms/aggregate/)).

Key properties:

1. `type`: Must be `aggregate`.
2. `ops`: An array of aggregation operations to apply.
3. `fields`: An array of columns to aggregate—must match the size of `ops`.
4. `as`: Names of the new aggregated fields (also matches the size of `ops` and `fields`). If omitted, Vega auto-generates names like *sum_sales, avg_rating*, etc.
5. `groupby`: Optional. If specified, the aggregation will be grouped by the given fields.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "exampleFormula",
      "values": [
        {"category": "SSC", "a": 9, "b": 7, "c": 5},
        {"category": "SSC", "a": 19, "b": 27, "c": 35},
        {"category": "HSC", "a": 99, "b": 79, "c": 59}
      ],
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "aggregate",
          "ops": ["average", "min", "variance", "count"],
          "fields": ["a", "b", "c", "c"],
          "groupby": ["category"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

There are a few more optional properties for advanced behavior, but we can skip those for now.

### 3. Filtering

Filtering lets you include or exclude rows based on a condition. In Vega, you use the `filter` transform, which is super straightforward:

1. `type`: `filter`
2. `expr`: A condition that evaluates to _true_ or _false_ for each row and this transform only returns the rows where the expression evaluates to _true_.

Once again, `datum` is used to refer to each row while writing the expression.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "exampleFormula",
      "values": [
        {"category": "SSC", "a": 9, "b": 7, "c": 5},
        {"category": "SSC", "a": 19, "b": 27, "c": 35},
        {"category": "HSC", "a": 99, "b": 79, "c": 59}
      ],
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "filter",
          "expr": "datum.category == 'SSC' && datum.c > 30"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Lookups

If you're familiar with Excel or Power BI, you know how powerful lookups can be.

In Vega, you can enrich a dataset by pulling values from another dataset using the `lookup` transform. This works just like {% glossary LOOKUP functions %} in Excel or the {% glossary RELATED %} function in Power BI.

Important properties:

1. `type`: `lookup`
2. `from`: The name of the dataset you're pulling data *from*.
3. `fields`: Columns from the current dataset to match against.
4. `key`: Column in the second dataset to match with.
5. `values`: Columns you want to bring in from the second dataset. If omitted, the full matching row is returned as an object.
6. `as`: Names of the new columns being added. Required if `fields` has multiple values or `values` is omitted.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "secondary",
      "values": [
        {"fullName": "Alice", "age": 19},
        {"fullName": "Bob", "age": 23},
        {"fullName": "Evans", "age": 39}
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "primary",
      "values": [
        {"firstName": "Alice", "lastName": "Smith"},
        {"firstName": "Bob", "lastName": "Jones"},
        {"firstName": "Carol", "lastName": "Evans"}
      ],
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "lookup",
          "from": "secondary",
          "key": "fullName",
          "fields": ["firstName", "lastName"],
          "values": ["age"],
          "as": ["age_1", "age_2"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This code looks up the _firstName_ from the primary table in the _fullName_ column of the secondary table and returns the _age_ column as *age_1*. Then it looks up the _lastNames_ from the primary table in the _fullName_ column of the secondary table and returns the _age_ column as *age_2*.

⚠️ The dataset you're looking *from* must be defined **before** the one doing the lookup, otherwise it won’t work.

### 5. Sorting

Sorting a dataset is another essential transformation. In Vega, we use the `collect` transform for this. It supports sorting by one or more columns in ascending or descending order.

1. `type`: `collect`
2. `sort`: An object with two keys:
   - `field`: An array of column names to sort by.
   - `order`: An array specifying the sort order for each field—either `ascending` or `descending`.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "exampleTable",
      "values": [
        {"fullName": "Alice", "age": 19},
        {"fullName": "Bob", "age": 23},
        {"fullName": "Evans", "age": 39}
      ],
      "transform": [
        {
          "type": "collect",
          "sort": {
            "field": ["age"],
            "order": ["descending"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

These are some of the most useful transformations you’ll find yourself using regularly. Vega supports many others like **flatten, window, stack, fold**, and so on. You can explore the full list [here](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/transforms/). And if there's a specific one you’d like explained with examples, just let me know—I'd be happy to help!

## Conclusion

Once your data is shaped and ready, it’s time to move on to the next step—scaling. In the next post, we’ll explore how to tell Vega where your data should go and how it should be mapped visually. Stay tuned!
