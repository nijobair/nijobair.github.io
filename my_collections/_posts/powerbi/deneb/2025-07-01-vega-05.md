## Introduction

The first step in any visualization is to get the data you want to work with. Vega is no different. Before you can show anything on the screen, you need to bring in the dataâ€”and Vega gives you several flexible ways to do just that. In this post, weâ€™ll explore how to import datasets using the `data` block.

## The `data` Block

In Vega, datasets are defined inside the `data` block. As mentioned in the previous post, this block takes an array, which means you can define multiple datasetsâ€”each one as a JSON object.

To make things easier, Vega provides some helpful properties you can use for each dataset. Letâ€™s take a look at a few of them and how they work:

- **`name`**: This is the only **_required_** property. Each dataset must have a unique name. If you use the same name more than once, the last one will overwrite the previous one. If you only provide the `name` and nothing else, youâ€™ll end up with an empty dataset.

- **`url`** & **`source`**:  Use `url` to load data from an external source. If you want to create a new dataset from an existing one, use the `source` property and reference the original datasetâ€™s name. This is especially useful for filtering or transforming data.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "jobs",
      "url": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-datasets@3.1.0/data/jobs.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "jobsCopy",
      "source": "jobs"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the first dataset (`jobs`) is loaded from an external link, and then a second one (`jobsCopy`) is created as a copy.

- **`format`**:  This defines how the data should be parsed. By default, Vega assumes external data is in JSON format. But if you're working with CSV, TSV, or other formats, you can use the `format` property to specify the correct type.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "jobs",
      "url": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-datasets@3.1.0/data/github.csv",
      "format": {"type": "csv"}
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`values`**:  This is used when you want to hardcode data directly in the spec. The most common format is JSON, but you can also use CSV or other formatsâ€”as long as you declare it in the `format` property.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "inlineJSON",
      "values": [
        {"a": 9, "b": 7, "c": 5},
        {"a": 19, "b": 27, "c": 35},
        {"a": 99, "b": 79, "c": 59}
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "inlineCSV",
      "values": "a,b,c\n9,7,5\n19,27,35\n99,79,59",
      "format": {"type": "csv"}
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above, we hardcoded the same dataset in two different formats. Take a look at how they show up in the code editor. Notice anything interesting? ðŸ¤”

## The `data` Block in Deneb

If youâ€™re using Vega inside Power BI with Deneb, things work a bit differentlyâ€”but also more conveniently.

When you drag columns and measures into the Deneb visual, it behaves just like the table visual in Power BI. Deneb automatically creates a dataset called `dataset` with the fields you've included. This dataset is exactly what youâ€™d see in a Power BI table visualâ€”with the same columns, measures, and row order.

To use this dataset in your Vega spec, you just need to reference `dataset` by name.

```json
{
  "data":[
    {
      "name": "dataset"
    }
  ]
}
```

You might notice a few extra columns you didnâ€™t add yourself. These are included by Deneb to support interactivity features like highlighting and filtering. Weâ€™ll dig into those later.
